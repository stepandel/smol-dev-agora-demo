1. **Dependencies**: Both "pages/index.tsx" and "pages/api/delegates.ts" will depend on "lib/fetchDelegates.ts" for fetching the list of delegates from the remote database. 

2. **Exported Variables**: The "lib/fetchDelegates.ts" will export a function named "fetchDelegates" which will be used in "pages/index.tsx" and "pages/api/delegates.ts". 

3. **Data Schemas**: The "types/index.d.ts" file will define the data schema for a delegate, which will be used across multiple files including "pages/index.tsx", "pages/api/delegates.ts", and "components/DelegateCard.tsx".

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The "pages/index.tsx" will contain DOM elements with ids such as "delegate-list", "pagination", and "delegate-card" which will be used in the JavaScript functions for manipulating these elements.

5. **CSS Modules**: The "styles/globals.css", "styles/DelegateCard.module.css", and "styles/Pagination.module.css" will be shared across "pages/index.tsx" and "components/DelegateCard.tsx", "components/Pagination.tsx" respectively for styling.

6. **Components**: The "components/DelegateCard.tsx" and "components/Pagination.tsx" will be used in "pages/index.tsx" for displaying the delegate cards and pagination.

7. **Configuration Files**: The "next.config.js", "package.json", and "tsconfig.json" will be shared across the entire application for configuration purposes.

8. **Public Assets**: The "public/images/default-delegate.png" will be used in "components/DelegateCard.tsx" for displaying the default delegate image.

9. **Function Names**: Functions like "fetchDelegates" from "lib/fetchDelegates.ts", "DelegateCard" from "components/DelegateCard.tsx", and "Pagination" from "components/Pagination.tsx" will be used in "pages/index.tsx".
